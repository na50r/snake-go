# Snake Go
This is an attempt to make a snake multi-player game. Mainly because snake seemed to be easy and I used it an excuse to work with WebSockets.

## Usage
Start the server with
```bash
go run main.go
```
Then run the client with VSCode Live Server extension or alike. 

## Frontend
* HTML (especially canvas)
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Backend
* Go
* WebSockets (Gorilla)
